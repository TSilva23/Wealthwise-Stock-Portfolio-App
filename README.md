# Wealthwise - Stocks Portfolio App

Welcome to Wealthwise, a stocks portfolio app created using React, Flask, and the AlphaVantage API.

I embarked on this journey to learn fullstack development and apply what I have learned so far of Python and JavaScript.

Learning to use React was one of the high points of this project for me. But without a doubt, learning to think like a full-stack developer is the most valuable lesson I've learned from this project.

The UI might be updated (sooner, or later), but this first version is built around functionality and efficiency first and foremost.

The next step for me is learning more about CSS frameworks like BootStrap and implement it in my next projects.

## Frontend

The frontend of the app can be accessed at the following URL:

[http://tristancapstonepr.storage.googleapis.com/](http://tristancapstonepr.storage.googleapis.com/)

## Backend

The backend of the app is hosted at the following URL:

[https://capstoneprojectmcsbt1.ew.r.appspot.com/](https://capstoneprojectmcsbt1.ew.r.appspot.com/)

To use the mock user, use the following credentials:

- Username: user2
- Password: 1234

Otherwise, feel free to register. It works!
